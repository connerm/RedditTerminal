# Reddit Termnial

Reddit Terminal is a python script for browsing reddit in bash (or other terminal)

Run reddit.py with either r/*subreddit* or search *your search terms* as cmd arguments
The script outputs the first "page" of posts with title, link, and comments link

TODO:
* viewing content pages
* selecting post then with user input then viewing content pages
* pagatio

I created this just for fun to play with some python libs and regexp
Use to look like your coding ;)

# Reddit Termnial

Reddit Terminal is a python script for browsing reddit in bash (or other terminal)

Run reddit.py with either r/*subreddit* or search *your search terms* as cmd arguments
The script outputs the first "page" of posts with title, link, and comments link

script then prompts for which comments to view (by inputing post number)
the script diplays comments is a simalar way to the post with username, points, and text

TODO: (if possible) comment indentation 

I created this just for fun to play with some python libs and regexp
Use to look like your coding ;)
